# Basic heatpump model.
#
# Keep in mind that when specifying the `capacity` in `electricity`, the maximum available heat output will vary, while
# if specifying it in `heat` the maximum output will stay fixed (at that given value), while the maximum `electricity`
# drawn from the input will vary.
#
# Parameters:
#   - elec_from: `Node` to take electricity from.
#   - heat_to: `Node` to feed heat to.
#   - capacity: Capacity of the heatpump (needs to include carrier).
#   - COP: The COP (default is based on a ground-source heatpump from the When2Heat dataset; hourly resolution for a
#          year. Set COP to `heatpump_cop_as@__default` for a similar air-source timeseries.
